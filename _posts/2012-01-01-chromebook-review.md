<p>As you may know already, I recently bought a <strong>Samsung Chromebook</strong>. Since it is a fairly new computer and reviews can be quite rare, I thought it would be a good idea to give you my feeling after a week or two of daily use.</p>
<p>Please note I may do a lot of comparisons with a MacBook old generation since it's the laptop I had before.</p>
