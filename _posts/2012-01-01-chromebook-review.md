<p>As you may know already, I recently bought a <strong>Samsung Chromebook</strong>. Since it is a fairly new computer and reviews can be quite rare, I thought it would be a good idea to give you my feeling after a week or two of daily use.</p>
<p>Please note I may do a lot of comparisons with a <a href="http://images.appleinsider.com/mb-081009.jpg">MacBook old generation</a> since it's the laptop I had before. I also have an <a href="http://cdn-static.zdnet.com/i/story/61/18/015531/zdnet-msi-gx740-laptop-computer.jpg">old MSI G Series (Black/red)</a> running on Linux.</p>

<p>So, the Chromebook is an ultraportable laptop from, well, Google running on Chrome OS mostly made for web browsing.</p>
<p>There are several Chromebooks: some are built by Samsung, some by Acer, some by HP. I personally took the Samsung Chromebook.</p>
