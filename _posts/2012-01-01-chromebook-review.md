<p>As you may know already, I recently bought a <strong>Samsung Chromebook</strong>. Since it is a fairly new computer and reviews can be quite rare, I thought it would be a good idea to give you my feeling after a week or two of daily use.</p>
<p>Please note I may do a lot of comparisons with both a MacBook Pro since my girlfriend has one, a <a href="http://images.appleinsider.com/mb-081009.jpg">MacBook old generation</a> since it's the laptop I had before. I also have an <a href="http://cdn-static.zdnet.com/i/story/61/18/015531/zdnet-msi-gx740-laptop-computer.jpg">old MSI G Series (Black/red)</a> running on Linux even if I don't use it much.</p>

<h2>Introduction <a href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>So, the Chromebook is an ultraportable laptop from, well, Google running on Chrome OS mostly made for web browsing.</p>
<p>There are several Chromebooks: some are built by Samsung, some by Acer, some by HP. I personally took the Samsung Chromebook.</p>

<h2>Hardware <a href="#hardware">#</a></h2>
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>Let's start by the whole hardware part. First of all, I think it's pretty nice even if it doesn't compete with the MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>I'm not very comfortable with very technical specifications so I'll just leave it here: Exynos 5 Dual Core 1.7Ghz, 2GB DDR3 RAM, 16GB SSD storage.</p>
<p>The whole shell is not in aluminium which is why you don't have the same feeling as the MBP, but that's definitely better when it comes to the weight. Indeed, the Chromebook 11.6" is very lightweight with only 1.1Kg (which has to be 2.4lbs to some of you) for 1.8cm thick.</p>
<p>In any case, you can tell it is a small laptop halfway through a regular laptop and a netbook.</p>
<h3>Screen</h3>
<p>The screen resolution is limited to 1366*768 which is enough if you want my opinion. However the screen quality isn't awesome. Indeed, the Chromebook uses a lower-end display with pretty bad sight angles. So you wouldn't buy the Chromebook for its screen.</p>
<p>Anyway, since this laptop is mostly made for web browsing and small applications, I think it's more than enough.</p>
<p>Thus I can still enjoy fullscreen Youtube videos without having my eyes bleeding, but I still prefer watching movies on my TV when I'm home (especially given the screen size).</p>
<h3>Audio</h3>
<p>There are two speakers on the bottom case which isn't great when the laptop is put on table, on your knees, on the couch, on the bed or pretty much anywhere. Yeah so, the sound isn't great.</p>
<p>It's not awful, definitely not awful but it's not high-quality sound. So if you want high-quality sound, you may need to plug in external speakers or headphones.</p>
<h3>Battery</h3>
<p>Oh man, this is good. You can count on about 6.5 hours battery lifetime with a regular usage.
