<h2>Me: you’re kind of a mysterious person. Maybe could you introduce yourself?</h2>

<p class="pull-quote--left">I create things for Codrops since 2009.</p>

<p>I'm Manoela, a 31 year old web designer and developer and I create things for <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/">Codrops</a> since 2009. I studied Cognitive Science in Germany and then Computational Logic in Portugal.</p>
<p>I worked in a software company for a while before I decided to become a freelancer and launch Codrops. Since I was a kid I was always fascinated with computers and I created my first website when I was 16 (it had some fancy Flash buttons, I remember) :)</p>
<p>In my personal life I like to travel a lot (in fact, most of the time I am). I love to eat and make good food, drink a great wine and take care of my balcony herb garden whenever I have some spare time.</p>

<h2>So you created Codrops. Could you tell us a little bit more about it? Where did the idea came from and what do you do for it?</h2>

<p>I set up a WordPress blog in late 2009 thinking that I could share some useful snippets with fellow developers. I was doing some beginner mobile web development back then and I just wanted to share what I learnt and what I thought could be helpful. Snippets turned into tutorials over time and now Codrops turned into an almost full-time job :)  </p>
<p>What I do is to plan, design and implement and write tutorials together with my partner <a href="https://twitter.com/o_telho">Pedro</a>. I also manage the blog and review articles by our writers.</p>

<h2>What is the biggest challenge at Codrops?</h2>

<p>I guess the most challenging but also most exciting part is to come up with interesting and original ideas and concepts that are somehow inspiring and helpful to web designers and developers. At Codrops we try to provide ideas and new perspectives that serve as a source of inspiration. So we always create a story for what we want to show and setting up that story is the most delicate part. </p>

<h2>Why did you choose to land on Wordpress? Who did the development (CSS, scripts and stuff)?</h2>

<p>WordPress seemed like the most fitting blog engine at the time and I've been happy with it ever since. I love the community around it. 
All the development and implementation was done by me and Pedro.</p>

<h2>If you could go back and change something at Codrops, what would it be?</h2>

<p class="pull-quote--right">if you are happy with what you've learned, it was a good path to choose.</p>

<p>There are always things that could be done better when looking back. But in general I am quite content with how Codrops turned out thanks to our readers and I wouldn't want to change anything about that I guess. It's just like with everything else in life: if you wouldn't have done it that exact way, you might have not learned what you know now. And if you are happy with what you've learned, it probably was a good path to choose. </p>

<h2>What do you plan for the future of Codrops?</h2>

<p>There are many things that we want to add to and improve at Codrops. We are currently working on some new sections that we want to release this year. And we are of course planning to do more tutorials and provide more articles that will be interesting and useful to our readers.</p>

<h2>Could you share a few datas about the site maybe? Traffic, authors, anything surprising?</h2>

<p>We currently have about **850.000 unique visitor** and **9.5 million pageviews** every month. Our readers spend an average of **4.25 minutes** on Codrops and they view about **6 pages per visit**. Almost half of them are from the United States. We have **512 published posts** and more than **20.000 comments**. In total, we have **45 authors**, most of whom were guest authors with a single contribution. </p>

<h2>What is the most successful article on Codrops so far? Related to the number of views.</h2>

<p>The most successful article was <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2011/11/02/original-hover-effects-with-css3/">Original Hover Effects</a>.</p>

<h2>Do you have any side project? What would you like to do if you had enough time?</h2>

<p>Yes, I have some side projects that I'm working on and I also work for some clients. If I had more time I would definitely spend it all on answering our reader's questions and help them with their problems. </p>

<h2>Anything left you’d like to say? :)</h2>

<p>I'd like to thank you for the opportunity and I'd like to thank all the readers of Codrops for their support. I'd also like to wish you all the best for your website and blog and I'm looking forward to read many of your articles :)</p>
