<p>Hey guys! Just a quick post to anounce the very recent launch of <a href="http://browserhacks.com">Browserhacks</a>!</p>
<blockquote><p>Browserhacks is an extensive list of browser specific CSS (and somewhat JavaScript) hacks gathered from all over the interwebz.</p></blockquote>
</section>
<section id="why">
<h2>Why doing this? <a href="#why" class="section-anchor">#</a></h2>
<p>There are two main reasons that lead us to create Browserhacks.</p>
<p>The first one is that we couldn't find a place where all (at least many) hacks were gathered (or it was way too old; Netscape 4 says hi!). The best spot at the moment is <a href="http://paulirish.com/2009/browser-specific-css-hacks/">this great blog post by Paul Irish</a>, but it's a) a blog post; b) there are a lot of interesting stuff in the hundred of comments nobody will ever read anymore.</p>
<p>Anyway, we thought it could be a good idea to get our hands a little dirty and merge <a href="http://paulirish.com/2009/browser-specific-css-hacks/">all</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/983116">the</a> <a href="http://www.impressivewebs.com/ie10-css-hacks/">cool</a> <a href="http://www.webcredible.co.uk/user-friendly-resources/css/hacks-browser-detection.shtml">sources</a> we could find on the topic into a lovely tool.</p>
<p>The other reason is that we wanted to do something together for quite a while now and it was a very good opportunity to do it! So we did.</p>

<section id="who">
<h2>Who is "we"? <a href="#who" class="section-anchor">#</a></h2>
<p><em>We</em> is the short for a group of 6 persons gathered under the sweet name of <a href="http://4ae9b8.com">4ae9b8</a>. How cool is that name, right?! Anyway, we are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/timpietrusky">Tim Pietrusky</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/mobilpadde">Mads Cordes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/fweinb">Fabrice Weinberg</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/thebabydino">Ana Tudor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/sarasoueidan">Sara Soueidan</a></li>
<li>and of course <a href="https://twitter.com/hugogiraudel">myself</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Even if in this project, Tim and I did most of the job. However everybody has participated by giving opinion, advices and making tests. :)</p>

<section id="how">
<h2>How to use it? <a href="#how" class="section-anchor">#</a></h2>
<p>It couldn't be any simpler. If you ever happen to be stuck on a rendering bug in let's say... Internet Explorer 7 (only an example...), you could simply:</p>
<ol>
<li>Come to <a href="http://browserhacks.com">Browserhacks.com</a>,</li>
<li>Search for "IE7",</li>
<li>Copy one of the proposed hacks,</li>
<li>Paste it in your stylesheet,</li>
<li>Keep CSS-ing worry-free!</li>
</ol>
<p class="note">If you don't feel like using this because you don't like CSS hacks (understandable), simply don't use it. However if you start trolling, God will kill many kittens.</p>

<section id="final-words">
<h2>Final words <a href="#final-words" class="section-anchor">#</a></h2>
<p>Browserhacks is built on a PHP/Backbone.js structure. The front-end stuff is built with <a href="http://timpietrusky.github.com/crystallo/">Tim's framework Crystallo</a> and Sass.</p>
<p>The source code is <a href="https://github.com/4ae9b8/browserhacks">available on GitHub</a>. If you find a bug, want to make a suggestion or propose a hack, please open an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/4ae9b8/browserhacks/issues?state=open">bug tracker</a>. Many kudos to you!</p>
<p>Here is what we plan on for the next version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put the hacks that matches in your browser first</li>
<li>Improve the search by adding moar filterz (like a type filter)</li>
<li>Improve the main site in Internet Explorer 8-</li>
<li>Add moar hackz!</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope you like it, happy hacking!</p>
