<p>Hey guys! I recently had the amazing opportunity to be a speaker at [KiwiParty](http://kiwipart.fr), a one-day French conference at Strasbourg where we talk about front-end technologies, accessibility, ergonomy, webdesin, and so much more.</p>
<p>We've been about 10 out of 40 to be picked to give a talk on the topic of our choice. I chose to talk about Sass.</p>
