title: Feedbacks on my first conf
---

<section>
<p>Hey guys! I recently had the amazing opportunity to be a speaker at <a href="http://kiwiparty.fr">KiwiParty</a>, a one-day French conference at Strasbourg gathering 10 speakers and more than 150 peoples to talk about front-end technologies, accessibility, ergonomy, webdesin, and so much more.</p>
<p>So Friday June 28 at 2:00PM I was on stage to talk about Sass, and how we can use preprocessors to push our stylesheets to an upper level: "Kick-ass CSS with Sass".</p>

<h2>About the conference <a href="#conference">#</a></h2>
<p>I've never been at a conference before so it was pretty much what I could expect. A bunch of awesome people, great talks, food, and most of all: web. It was an amazing day, for sure.</p>
<p>Plus, we had the opportunity to meet two awesome dudes of our field:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bert Bos -co-creator of CSS- introduced the day by telling us about <a href="http://www.w3.org/Talks/2013/0628-CSS-Strasbourg/">CSS for books</a>. Pretty amazing what we can know do with CSS when we know it was first intented to style basic text documents.</li>
<li>Tristan Nitot -founder of Mozilla Europe- concluded the conference by talking about Firefox OS. He's an awesome speaker. Totally worth seeing it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could also meet all those great French guys from Twitter and put some faces on names. Cool thing, really. :)</p>

<section id="talk">
<h2>About my talk <a href="#talk">#</a></h2>
<p>It went great. People seemed very interested in the topic and were receptive regarding of what I could say.</p>
<p>I was kind of nervous, obviously. My laptop dying the night before the big day was not to help though... Hopefully I could buy a Chromebook (which will probably the topic for another article) and all went well.</p>
<blockquote class="pull-quote--right">This experience was kind of incredible actually.</blockquote>
<p>This experience was kind of incredible actually. I walked into that room were dozens and dozens of people were waiting for me to talk to them. My hands were kind of sweaty and I was shivering a little at first but it all disappeared when I started talking.</p>
<p>Then a little voice popped in my head saying "dude, this is too complicated", or "this is obvious to you but not for them" or "what the hell are you trying to explain?". It stayed there during the whole conference and was kind of disturbing. I couldn't have real-time feedbacks of course (imagine what it would look like) so I had no idea if people were enjoying my talk or hoping it was soon finished.</p>
<p>In the end, I had a couple of questions (most of them very relevant) which I was prepared to answer. Yeah that's right, I prepared the Q&A guys! </p>

<h2>Moar! <a href="#moar">#</a></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, my talk hasn't been recorded so no way to access it online, sorry guys. :(</p>
<p>Regarding pictures, my <a href="http://alexandralucas.com">girlfriend</a> took a couple of photos as you can see in this article. Otherwise, you can find more pics of the whole event on Flickr,tagged KiwiParty.</p>
<p>Of, and of course here are my <a href="http://slid.es/hugogiraudel/css-kick-ass-avec-sass/">slides</a> (in French, but it's mostly code); read top to bottom then left to right.</p>

<p>So all in all, it was an amazing experience. Big thanks to the Alsacreations team and to all of you who were in the room to hear my talk.</p>
<p>I hope to be part of it next year as well. Meanwhile, I'm available to hack your Sass. ;)</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
