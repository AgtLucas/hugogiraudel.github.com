<p>Hey guys! The blog is 6 months old today. Launched in <a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2012/11/09/redesign-blog/">November 9th 2012</a> as a quick and dirty plateform to drop some posts when I get time, I have to say I am pretty happy with what I have done so far with this.</p>

<h3>About the blog</h3>
<p>In 6 months, I've released exactly 30 articles (this is 31st) including 3 specials: 2 interviews (<a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/04/23/interview-by-clement-osternaud/">one of me from Cl√©ment Osternaud</a> and <a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/03/11/interview-manoela-ilic/">one of Manoela Ilic from me</a>) and a guest post (<a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/02/04/css-gradients/">from Ana Tudor</a>).</p>
<p>The most successful article is definitely <a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/02/04/css-gradients/">Dig deep into CSS linear gradients</a> (the guest post from Ana Tudor) with about 30,000 viewed pages. Then it is a very old one: <a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2012/11/13/less-to-sass/">Why I switched from LESS to Sass</a> with over 12,000 viewed pages. The third most successful article is <a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/04/30/css-aha-moment/">My CSS aha moment</a> with over 11,000 viewed pages. Note that other articles like <a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/04/08/css-alternative-select/">Why a CSS alternative to the select element is not possible</a>, <a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/01/28/float-down/">Simulate float: down</a> and <a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/04/04/css-grid-layout/">Future of CSS layout: Grid</a> has been very welcomed.</p>
<p>All articles have drawn more than 80,000 unique visitors for about 150,000 viewed pages. The average visit duration is about one minut, and the number of page per visit is about 1.4.</p>

</figure>
<p>Enough about me, let's talk about you: about 28% of users come from United State, 8% come from United Kingdom, then a little more than 7% from France.</p>
<p>Regarding browser, I'm a lucky bastard: Chrome gets more than 60% of the browser share on my site, then it's Firefox with 17.5%, and then Safari with 16%. Internet Explorer comes with 1.8%.</p>
<p>About 14% users are reading articles on their mobile phone (cf. fig 1). About 7 out of 10 users use an Apple phone. The 3 others use Android (I'm in).</p>
<p>The most important traffic source is definitely <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> (actually t.co), then it's <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a< and then <a href="http://tympanus.com/codrops/">Codrops</a>. A little further behind, we have <a href="http://sidebar.io">Sidebar.io</a>, <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> and <a href="http://css-tricks.com">CSS-Tricks</a>.</p>

<h2>What's next? <a href="#">#</a></h2>
<p>You tell me. Is there anything you'd like to see?</p>
<p>I'm thinking about adding an excerpt for each blog post to the home page. I think some people asked for it. My problem with this is that excerpt are a pain in the ass to do if you want to do it right, and when generated, it generally sucks. I'll see if I can come up with a decent solution.</p>
<p>I would also like to add a small banner for <a href="http://browserhacks.com">Browserhacks</a> on the sidebar. I'll work that out anytime soon.</p>
<p>Anyway, thank you all for reading. That's what keeps me writing. ;)</p>
